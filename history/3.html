                    Anatolian Rock remained popular until the late 1970s. During these times, some musicians have taken
                    a stand in support of the common people. One such person was Selda Bagcan. Musicians like Bagcan
                    were able to speak directly to the people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For young, popular music became synonymous with leftist thinking, protests for greater equality,
                    freedom and worker's rights. The left-wing views of these artists did not endear them to the authorities.

                    By 1970s went on, economic recession and social unrest has arisen across Turkey and in 12th September
                    1980, military coup brought the Anatolian rock genre to an end. Left-wing rockers faced repression,
                    while the gloomy political atmosphere boosted the popularity of the melancholic Arabesque genre during
                    the 80s.

                <p>
                    After the coup, rock musicians were banned from performing, many artists had to fled abroad such as
                    Cem Karaca and some were imprisoned.
