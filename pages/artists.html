                            Selda Bagcan is a Turkish folk singer-songwriter, guitarist, and music producer. Her career as a professional musician started in 1971, during her final year at the university, with the encouragement and support of the Ankara-based music producer Erkan Ozerman. The six singles she released that year, in which she interpreted traditional Turkish folk songs in a strong, emotional voice, accompanied by a simple acoustic guitar or baglama, carried her to national fame.
